# VirtualDesktopassistant
It's a small software where you can pass commands to the assistant and it lends back the information to the respective user.

## Steps
- Install the packages in the main file and go through the code.. 
- Prefer Visualstudio for executing the code and install "Pyaudio" for your python version(https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio). I prefer 3.5 py version. Enjoy your assistant.
